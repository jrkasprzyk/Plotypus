# Plotypus

Fork of [Platypus](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus) with a focus on visualization and interactive exploration.

### What is Plotypus?

Plotypus inherits rich evolutionary computing infrastructure from Platypus, which is a framework for evolutionary computing in Python with a focus on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).

### What's different from Platypus?

Plotypus is an experimental repo that adds functionality to the original Platypus including:

- **Interactive GUI** — Plotypus Explorer lets you pick an algorithm and test problem, set parameters, and watch the Pareto front evolve live while the optimization runs.
- **Expanded problem library** — the ZDT, WFG, UF, and CF problem families are included and accessible directly from the package alongside the existing DTLZ suite.
- **Human-in-the-loop example** — `examples/madlibs_moea.py` demonstrates using an MOEA with a human as the evaluator, as a simple proof-of-concept.

### Example

Optimizing a simple biobjective problem with a single real-valued decision variable:

```python
from plotypus import NSGAII, Problem, Real

def schaffer(x):
    return [x[0]**2, (x[0]-2)**2]

problem = Problem(1, 2)
problem.types[:] = Real(-10, 10)
problem.function = schaffer

algorithm = NSGAII(problem)
algorithm.run(10000)
```

### Running the GUI

```
python gui/app.py
```

Requires `matplotlib` and `tkinter` (tkinter ships with most Python distributions).

### Installation

To install the latest development version of Plotypus, first install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if not already installed:

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Then clone and install Plotypus:

```
git clone https://github.com/jrkasprzyk/Plotypus.git
cd Plotypus
poetry install
```
