# Plotypus

[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/Plotypus.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/Plotypus/)

Fork of [Platypus](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus) with visualization focus.

### What is Plotypus?

Plotypus is a framework for evolutionary computing in Python with a focus on
multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).  It differs from existing
optimization libraries, including PyGMO, Inspyred, DEAP, and Scipy, by providing
optimization algorithms and analysis tools for multiobjective optimization.
It currently supports NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, IBEA, Epsilon-MOEA, SPEA2, GDE3,
OMOPSO, SMPSO, and Epsilon-NSGA-II.  For more information, see the
[examples](examples/).

### Example

For example, optimizing a simple biobjective problem with a single real-valued
decision variable is accomplished in Plotypus with:

```python

    from plotypus import NSGAII, Problem, Real

    def schaffer(x):
        return [x[0]**2, (x[0]-2)**2]

    problem = Problem(1, 2)
    problem.types[:] = Real(-10, 10)
    problem.function = schaffer

    algorithm = NSGAII(problem)
    algorithm.run(10000)
```

### Installation

To install the latest Plotypus release, run the following command:

```
    pip install plotypus
```

To install the latest development version of Plotypus, first install
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if not already installed:

```
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Then clone and install Plotypus:

```
    git clone https://github.com/jkasprzyk/Plotypus.git
    cd Plotypus
    poetry install
```
